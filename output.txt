Maven configuration (what to remember)

File: pom.xml

Key sections:

<groupId>, <artifactId>, <version>

<dependencies> (ex: JUnit)

<build> + plugins (ex: surefire for tests)

Standard layout:

src/main/java for app code

src/test/java for tests

Selecting a thorough set of tests (how to think fast)

Use preconditions + postconditions:

Typical/normal case

Boundary cases (min/max, empty, 0, 1)

Invalid cases (null, negative, out of range) if allowed/expected

Special cases (duplicates, case sensitivity, whitespace, overflow)

If method throws exceptions: test that exception type happens when it should

Writing a type definition (class/enum/record)

enum: small fixed set of named values (traffic light colors)

record: data carrier with fields + auto getters/equals/hashCode/toString

class: behavior + mutable state + invariants + multiple constructors, etc.
